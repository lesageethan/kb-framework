A one kilobyte, ultra-low-emissions CSS framework.

## About the Framework

KB Framework is an ultra-low-emissions CSS framework, coming in at just 786 bytes when minified and gzipped.

It is important to note that this framework will need to be used in conjunction with custom CSS rules, as it is only intended to offer an incredibly lightweight skeleton for a web page. This framework does not offer complete styling.

Also worth noting, this was developed in just a few weeks by one person (me), and so is not perfect. There may be small issues with padding or margins when certain elements are placed together on a page, but any of these issues can easily be corrected with CSS.
